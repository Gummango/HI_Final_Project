# Hospital Clinical Data Warehouse (Tkinter GUI App)

Greetings all, this is Giridhar Kommalapati. This is my final project for the course HI 741 – Spring 2025. I created a simple Python application using Tkinter that helps hospital staff manage clinical data like patient visits, clinical notes, and statistics.

The program includes a login system and gives access based on different user roles. Each user gets only the features they’re allowed to use.

## 1. What the Project Does

- Lets users log in using their credentials (from `Credentials.csv`)
- Based on their role, they can:
  - Add or remove patient visits
  - View a patient's recent visit
  - Count how many patients visited on a given date
  - View clinical notes for a specific visit
  - Generate statistics (for management only)
- All patient data is saved to and loaded from CSV files
- The system also keeps track of who logged in and what actions they performed in `Usage_Log.csv`

## 2. How to Run It

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Download or clone** this GitHub repository: https://github.com/Gummango/HI_Final_Project.git
2. **Open the project in PyCharm** (or any Python IDE)

3. Make sure you have Python 3.8 or later installed.

4. Install the required packages by running this in the terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Run the program using: python main.py

6. The login screen will appear.  
Use a valid username and password from the `data/Credentials.csv` file.

7. After logging in, you will see a menu with buttons based on your role (admin, nurse, etc.)

>  If running from a different IDE or text editor, make sure the working directory is set to the project root.




## 3. Roles and What They Can Do

| Role           | Features Available                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Admin**      | Count visits on a specific date                          |
| **Nurse**      | Add, remove, retrieve patients, count visits, view notes |
| **Clinician**  | Same as Nurse                                            |
| **Management** | Generate key statistics and see result charts            |
Each role gets a different menu based on their access level.

## 4. Dependencies and How to Install
